<!-- Have a drop-down to select which Band recorded the Album.
Use selected to default-select the appropriate Band in the drop-down.


Use radio buttons to select whether the album is a live or studio album.
Don't use a column named type,
  since Rails uses this for a special purpose and everything will break.
Use checked to default select the appropriate value. -->
